# Build a JavaScript Promise

The CPromise.js implements and imitates the built-in JavaScript Promise, including primary functionalities and error handling. Hopefully, this can be a helpful martrial for studying JavaScript Promise.

The current version of the CPromise provides the following functions: 
- CPromise.all()
- CPromise.race()
- CPromise.reject()
- CPromise.resolve()
- CPromise.then()
